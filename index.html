                    Greetings, my name is <strong>Ethan Chapman</strong>, and I am a 21-year-old student at SDCC and SDSU. I am studying Electrical Engineering. The reason I am taking this course is because HTML seems to be a very handy skill and also looks good on a resume. Recently, a bunch of my friends did internships/had jobs where HTML was a required part of the work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hope that by the end of this class I might be able to build websites that look as good as any other website. Hopefully, I could be proficient enough by the end of this course to do HTML as a part-time job for someone or for an internship. I have not had prior experience with HTML but have lots of experience with Assembly and limited experience with C and other assorted high-level programming languages.
                </p>

            <p>
                In my free time, I like to build things and play at the beach with my friends. My dad is a woodworker and has an impressive (to me) collection of tools both new and old, and over the years, I have come to learn the ins and outs of each one. I use my skills as a woodworker to create things in my garage all the time, such as:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-group mb-4">
                <li class="list-group-item">Surfboards</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Guitars/Ukuleles</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Furniture</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Repairwork relating to fiberglass</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Repairwork relating to electronics</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Just messing with stuff I find in the garage</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                When Iâ€™m not building or fixing things, my friends and I go surfing, diving, or paddling at the beach.
